**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** toxictager
**Platform:** Windows / Linux
**Language:** Python 3.9+

SpecterX is a powerful, modular red team and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) automation toolkit written in Python. It unifies essential reconnaissance, enumeration, brute-force, and intelligence-gathering tasks into an interactive terminal-driven environment with live auto-updating HTML reporting.

Designed for ethical hackers, bug bounty hunters, students, and cybersecurity analysts, SpecterX is clean, fast, and extensible.

## 🔍 Core Features

* ✨ Interactive CLI interface with clearly organized tool categories
* 🔎 Recon modules: Subdomain, Ports, Web Fingerprint, LAN
* 🤖 OSINT modules: Usernames, Domains, Emails
* 🔐 Brute-Force: FTP and SSH
* 📊 Live HTML reporting with auto-refresh and module filtering
* 🔄 Modular architecture, easy to expand

## 🔹 Modules Overview

### 🔧 Technical Recon

* **Subdomain Scanner**
  DNS brute-force using a wordlist

* **Port Scanner + Exploit Matcher**
  Threaded TCP scan with banner grabbing + CVE lookup via exploits.json

* **Web Fingerprinter**
  Title, CMS, server headers, X-Powered-By

* **LAN IP Scanner**
  Full network device discovery via ARP and ping sweep

### 🕵️ OSINT

* **Username Scanner**
  Detect accounts on GitHub, Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, etc.

* **Domain OSINT**
  WHOIS and full DNS records (A, MX, TXT, NS)

* **Email OSINT**
  Gravatar check + MX records

### 🔐 Brute-Force Tools

* **FTP Brute-Force** using `ftplib`
* **SSH Brute-Force** using `paramiko`
* Username/password wordlist support

## 📅 Live HTML Reporting

All module outputs are written to `output/report.html`:

* Timestamped sections with headings and preformatted results
* Filter buttons (Port Scanner, OSINT, etc.)
* Live auto-refresh every few seconds
* Easy to review across sessions or export

---
